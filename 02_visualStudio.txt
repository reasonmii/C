● Convert File : C++ -> C

default : cpp = C++

Method2)
Solution Explorer - Click 'MyFirstPrj.cpp' + F2 = rename - MyFirstPrj.c

Method2)
Solution Explorer - Right click 'MyFirstPrj' - Properties - C/C++
1) Language : Check 'C++ Language Standard'
2) Advanced : Find 'Compile As Default' - Change to 'Compile As C Code(/TC)'

After converting, some codes in the script would have red lines
This is because they are for C++, not C

// stdio : 표준입출력 standard input output
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	printf("Hello, World!");
	return 0;
}
